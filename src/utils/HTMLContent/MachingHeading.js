      A greenhouse is a house made entirely of glass: both walls and roof
      are glass. One of the main purposes of a greenhouse is to grow
      tomatoes, flowers and other plants that might struggle to grow
      outside. A greenhouse stays warm inside, even during winter. Sunlight
      shines in and warms the plants and air inside. But the heat is trapped
      by the glass and cannot escape. So during the daylight hours, it gets
      warmer and warmer inside a greenhouse, and stays quite warm at night
      too.

      The Earth experiences a similar thing to a greenhouse. Gases in the
      atmosphere such as carbon dioxide do what the roof of a greenhouse
      does. During the day, the Sun shines through the atmosphere. Earth’s
      surface warms up in the sunlight. At night, Earth’s surface cools,
      releasing the heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped
      by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That is what keeps our
      Earth a warm and comfortable 59 degrees Fahrenheit, on average.

      However, gas molecules, called greenhouse gases, that absorb thermal
      infrared radiation, and are in significant enough quantity, can force
      and alter the climate system. Carbon dioxide (CO)

      Many scientists agree that the damage to the Earth’s atmosphere and
      climate is past the point of no return or that the damage is near the
      point of no return. In Josef Werne’s opinion, an associate professor
      at the department of geology & planetary science at the University of
      Pittsburgh told Live Science, we have three options. Firstly to do
      nothing and live with the consequences. Secondly, to adapt to the
      changing climate (which includes things like rising sea level and
      related flooding). Thirdly, mitigate the impact of climate change by
      aggressively enacting policies that actually reduce the concentration
      of CO2 in the atmosphere.
